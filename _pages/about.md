👨🏻‍💻 I'm a third-year PhD student at Virginia Tech co-advised by [Dr. Thang Hoang](https://thanghoang.github.io) and [Dr. Taejoong Chung](https://taejoong.github.io).

🔬 My research interests are solving real-world network security problems with fancy cryptographic tools.

📚 I'm currently working with fancy crypto protocols like zero-knowledge proofs, multiparty computation, cryptographic accumulators, etc. to make Web PKI and Email PKI more secure and better.
